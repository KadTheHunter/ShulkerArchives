# Build Changes
- First cutouts of Item Wings gained their third side.
  - *This was initially an oversight in design that I later kept because it maintained the cool wall pattern; When importing Items however, it became clear the first cutouts needed to have three sides like all the rest, so I fixed it.*
- Item Wing Curves now have additional barrels, used to hold Cross-Category Item Sets (CCIS).
  - *There are very few (and likely always will be very few) Item Sets, even fewer of which are Cross-Category, so I tweaked the left and right side of the half-walls on either side of the curve to hold CCIS.*
- Removed two errant patches of flowers along the tree borders for the East/West wings

# Organization/Display Changes
- Text Displays have been placed at the opening of each category with that categories name; Hidden entity names differentiate between cutouts with the same category name.
  - *I've amassed a small collection of Command Blocks, Signs, Armorstands and more that are backups for those on the map right now. In the full release version, I'll include a barrel somewhere with these backup copies, for emergency purposes.*
- Light Blocks have been placed at strategic places in the Item Wings, Upper Level (Books and Unnamed Kits), and the Archivist Pick cutout.
- Minor visual tweaks to the Credit signs at the front of the center statue
- Added "Author Busts" at the upper level of the entrance
  - *These busts are meant to showcase some of the best/most prolific authors in the Archive. As new authors emerge in the NBT scene I'll do my best to expand and update the busts.*
