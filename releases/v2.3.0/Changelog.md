# Summary / Notes
In total there are now 747 Entries.

The Shulker Archives now also has a version using [NBT Database](https://github.com/mega12345mega/NBT-Database), a new tool by the developer of [NBT Editor](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-editor), _mega12345mega_. 
It allows storing exported items in a database (complete with Tags, Author Name/UUID, etc.) browsable via GUI or (if hosted as a local server) via website.

Attached in the Downloads below is a copy of the NBT Database for v2.3.0; Please refer to the linked repository above for information on how to use it.
