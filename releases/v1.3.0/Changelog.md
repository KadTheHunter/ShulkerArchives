# Summary / Notes
In total there are now 2,420 Entries

This update largely consists of submissions from the NBT Archives server, but also has a handful of odds and ends from my ClientChest that were missed in the last update.

Unlike other releases, I am providing three versions of the map, one each for Minecraft 1.20.4, 1.20.5 and 1.20.6. I will continue to use and develop on 1.20.4 for now, but the 1.20.5 and 1.20.6 branches are provided for anyone who wants them: be warned however, that I have not verified the integrity of the 1.20.5 and 1.20.6 branches yet. *Ideally* they are intact and everything has been upgraded properly, but there have been mojang bug reports (specifically [MC-271159](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271159), [MC-271222](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271222), [MC-271220](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271220) and [MC-271094](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-271094)) that 1.20.5 did *not* properly upgrade things.

The Modpack will be using the 1.20.4 release of the map, as few of the mods within have been updated and thus the modpack is still 1.20.4.

# Build Changes
- Added a small platform at `0, 0, 0` that contains two entries whose contents credits were stolen. A future update (focused on Build Improvements) will flesh out this platform, and provide proper access to it. Neither of the entries there now are listed in the [Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/database/).
  - _Both entries contents were largely made by MarioKartWii, but Marios name was replaced with theirs in a poor attempt to claim credit for something they knew they could never make themselves. I didn't want these in the main body of the Archives for obvious reasons, but I feel it's important to highlight them as examples of credit thievery._
