# Summary / Notes
Over the course of many months, I (Kadalyst) and AbdulFmMicrosoft have worked hard to renovate [The Great Olivia Library](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/great-olivia-library/) by [Aminto](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/aminto/), with two goals in mind:
- Making it suitable for holding thousands of entries
- Making it visually appealing

...and quite honestly, I think we succeeded.

The general color scheme and theme may not be for everyone, but I've long since accepted that and decided I don't care; Say what you will about the colors and theme, but we succeeded in upgrading it.

# Changes
Below is a list of the changes we made to the map, divided between structural changes and cosmetic changes.

## Structural
*These changes affected the structure of the building itself*

- Extended the depth of the cutouts in the North and South hallway
- Cut off the East/West wings, and replaced them with custom wings cobbled together from an upper level roof and some freehand designs.
- Gutted the (now extended) cutouts in the North hallway in favor of a single large cutout on each side
- Minor tweaks to the ceilings of cutouts and mid-level landings

## Cosmetic
*These changes affected the visual look of the building*

- Swapped the majority of the stone and stone variants (cobbled, bricks, smooth) for their deepslate variants
- Swapped or removed all redstone lamps in favor of glass covered frog lights
- Removed the Bookshelves running down the middle of the North and South hallways and inside the cutouts
- Replaced the tree in the center with a statue (itself cobbled together from two other statues + a free-handed Shulker Box)
- Replaced all floors with custom designs utilizing concrete, concrete powder, terracotta, and deepslate tiles
- Replaced various styling and decor with fancier or nicer versions

## Gardens
*These changes affected the gardens and outdoor portions of the build*

- Northern fountains given patterned flowerbeds surrounding them
- Southern flowerbeds replaced with custom trees
- Rectangular fountains re-colored and shifted to accommodate the structural changes to the East/West wings
- Hedge trims changed to Spruce and lighting to Sculk Catalyst
- Pathways reworked to accommodate the changes to the East/West wings while maintaining original style and layout
- General flower spam removed
- Custom trees added around East/West wings
- Border trees replaced with similarly uniform custom spruce trees
