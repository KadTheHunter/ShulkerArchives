# Summary / Notes
In total there are now 1,873 Entries and 15 Collections.

The majority of new entries this release come from the voluminous depths of my Hotbar files/Client Chest pages (which appear to have become some sort of hybrid between a Black Hole, the Bermuda Triangle and wherever it is that missing socks go). Several of the added entries I knew existed (and that I had copies of) but only just now discovered where they were, and the same goes for a great many more entries coming in the future.

This release marks the debut of not just the Map and Website, but of the [Database](/database/) as well. While former iterations of the Archives all had some form of database, this is the first to be condensed into a single table, and also the first to properly organize the data. While I still heavily encourage exploring the Archives on your own, if you're looking for a specific entry then the Database exists to help you find it.

I have also created a [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cfq25qURfv) for The Shulker Archives, and I'll post updates for the Website and Map there, as well as various other NBT Related things (plus the occasional giveaways of Steam Keys). Be sure to join and subscribe to the Site and Map Update Roles, and if you're an Author be sure to claim your Shulker role, and share your latest creations in the Showcase category!

# Build Changes
- Bare patches in the gardens filled with grass
  - *This is most noticeable at the orange trees to the right of the entrance, and the perimeter pine trees.*
- Changed the trunk/wood of one of the pine trees close to the item wing from oak to spruce
  - *I have no idea why it was oak, if the original was always oak, or why the original would have been oak, but it's fixed now.*
- Fixed inconsistency with the moulding near Item wings, where the pattern was incorrectly mirrored/adapted
  - *Thanks to Beta Tester* beccaxoxo *for finding this; I have no idea how you found it, but thank you.*

# Organization/Display Changes
- Added my Discord ([@kadalyst](https://discordapp.com/users/979472935154753626)) to the Credit signs
- Removed all the "Dummy Shulker :D" signs in the Kits hallway and Unnamed Kits cutout.
  - *This should both alleviate FPS drops and make it easier to tell which barrels have entries.*
- Fixed an error in the Author Busts curve where SolleeRockeeee was incorrectly aliased as Emphacks rather than DashTheDevilDog
- Credited *antigamesm12* to the *Dead Bush Kit*
- Misc. typo corrections on entry signs
