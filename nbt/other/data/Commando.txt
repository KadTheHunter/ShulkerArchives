Works on 1.7 to 1.19.2
{"translate":"%0$s"}

Curious, something similar was patched a while back
it was %s I think
Wonder what exactly causes the crash
Does translate tag have regular expressions or something?

It's simple
when handling placeholders like %1$s, the game subtracts 1 from the numerical part of that placeholder so that it can grab the first element of an array
problem is they never accounted for the numerical part being 0, so it ends up subtracting 1 from 0, resulting in -1
anybody who has ever programmed in java with arrays will tell you that trying to get the -1st item in an array will throw an out of bounds exception
that is how the exploit works

Ahh that makes a lot of sense
