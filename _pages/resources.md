# Recommended Mods, Websites, Software and Servers

NBT Editor is the current pinnacle of NBT Editing Mods, making creating and editing items a breeze, with a variety of advanced features, including the ability to Import and Export `.nbt` files, retrieval of "lost" items via its /get lostitem history command, and its amazing Client Chest, which by default has 100 large chests' space for items, but can be expanded infinitely.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/NBTAutocomplete.webp){: .align-left} NBT Autocomplete](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-autocomplete)
NBT Autocomplete auto-suggests appropriate components, tags and values, making item-creation via commands incredibly easy. It also is fully integrated with NBT Editor, allowing you to use it in all the relevant screens and menus.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/FZMM.webp){: .align-left} FZMM](https://modrinth.com/mod/FZMM)
FZMM is a somewhat niche but still incredible mod, offering tons of advanced features like creating Lore Art/Hologram Art, modifying Player Head Data to add custom textures, a GUI for designing Banners, and an excellent array of tools to give text everything from simple colors to beautiful gradients.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/CFX.webp){: .align-left} CFX](https://modrinth.com/mod/cfx)
CFX blocks a variety of exploits and vulnerabilities found in Minecraft, with patches for versions 1.14.0 to 1.21.4. Very useful when working with Abuse items, or other dangerous bits of NBT.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/MoulberrysTweaks.webp){: .align-left} MoulberrysTweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/moulberrystweaks)
MoulberrysTweaks is a collection of fixes, tweaks, enhancements and improvements from the creator of Axiom and Flashback. Of particular interest to item-makers and NBT enthusiasts is the Item Component and Packet Debug widgets.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/ComponentViewer.webp){: .align-left} Component Viewer](https://modrinth.com/mod/component-viewer)
Component Viewer is an effective if rather rudimentary way of viewing an items data, by displaying it in the tooltip, with keybinds to toggle visibility and cycle through the components.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/MapPNG.webp){: .align-left} Map.png](https://modrinth.com/mod/map.png)
Map.png allows downloading and converting Minecraft maps to `.png` images at the press of a keybind, in both Single and Multiplayer gamemodes.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/ArmorStands.webp){: .align-left} Armor Stands](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-stands)
Armor Stands allows editing truly anything about an armor stand, from its individual limbs and their position, to pre-set poses, precise positioning and inventory, all with clean, well designed menus.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/Librarian.webp){: .align-left} Librarian](https://modrinth.com/mod/librarian)
Librarian overhauls the existing feature of Saved Hotbars, and while its main feature of allowing infinite hotbars is amazing enough, it also features overwrite protection, so you'll never accidentally lose items again, as well as renaming hotbars to help you keep everything organized.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/SymbolChat.webp){: .align-left} Symbol Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/symbol-chat)
Symbol Chat adds a menu to Chat, Signs, Books, and most other Text Inputs that allows you to use different fonts, and all manner of unicode symbols. You can search for and favorite any UNICODE symbol, even those unsupported by Minecraft.

***

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/SongPlayer.webp){: .align-left} SongPlayer](https://modrinth.com/mod/songplayer)
Song Player plays valid `.midi` and `.nbs` song files on Note Blocks. While this alone (and how it does it) is fairly impressive, the NBT aspect comes in with Song Items: Items with song data encoded to them in an NBT tag, allowing sharing of songs so other users can play them without having copies of the files. Now *that's* impressive.

I had to make this image from scratch, because for some fucking reason MCASelector only has a 16x16 copy of their icon. 
Thankfully I'm mildly proficient in GIMP, but that's still about an hour of my life I'm not getting back.

### [![image-left]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/resource-icons/MCASelector.webp){: .align-left} MCA Selector](https://github.com/Querz/mcaselector)
MCA Selector is *intended* to be used as a tool for exporting or deleting chunks from a Minecraft world; What it can *also* be used for, is mass-editing the NBT of selected chunks. Ever needed to mass-edit the `DataVersion` tag of several hundred chunks? I have, and MCA Selector did when nothing else could/would!
