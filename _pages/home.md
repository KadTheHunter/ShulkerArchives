**The Shulker Archives** is the ultimate collection of Component data (formerly NBT data) for Minecraft 1.20.0 to 1.21.5 in the form of Shulker Kits, Items, Books and more, organized into a variety of categories, and recorded into the [Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/database/) for ease of access.

Started in January 2023, the Archives have grown from a little collection of `/give` commands, to a huge map with hundreds of entries.

The Shulker Archives has ended with v2.3.0 for 1.21.5-1.21.8; For newer versions of Minecraft (1.21.11+), please see [NBT Library](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/NBT-Library)

[NBT Archives](https://discord.gg/ZhJyamzvvE) is the largest public collection of Component Data for Minecraft, where users can easily submit their creations for all to see. While it isn't as organized or filtered as The Shulker Archives, it more than makes up for that with the sheer quantity of entries, and the ability for everyone to submit their creations instantaneously.
