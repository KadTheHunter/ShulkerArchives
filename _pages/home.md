**The Shulker Archives** is the ultimate collection of Component data (formerly NBT data) in the form of Shulker Kits, Items, Books and more, organized into a variety of categories, and recorded into the [Database]({{ site.baseurl }}/database/) for ease of access.

Started in January 2023, the Archives have grown from a little collection of `/give` commands, to a massive map with thousands of entries. Though it has been reduced with the v2.0.0 release for Minecraft v1.21.1+, it continues to grow with semi-regular updates.

[NBT Archives](https://discord.gg/ZhJyamzvvE) is the largest public collection of Component Data for Minecraft, where users can easily submit their creations for all to see. While it isn't as organized or filtered as The Shulker Archives, it more than makes up for that with the sheer quantity of entries, and the ability for everyone to submit their creations instantaneously.
