The Shulker Archives is a project run and maintained by [Kadalyst](https://namemc.com/profile/Kadalyst.2) intended to preserve copies of as many Shulker Kits, Items, Books and NBT-Related things as possible, while still maintaining a degree of quality.

It was initially a website-based collection, formerly located here, and presently located at [ShulkerArchives-Legacy](https://kadthehunter.github.io/ShulkerArchives-Legacy/), but it quickly grew outdated and broken due to Minecraft introducing breaking changes to NBT, and a colossal mess internally due to multiple major rewrites.

On November 13th 2023, the website-based collection was marked as No Longer Maintained (NLM) due to multiple major issues, and focus turned to a map-based alternative, which debuted with its [beta.1]({{ site.baseurl }}/releases/v1.0.0-beta.1/Changelog/) release in mid-January 2024, and full [v1.0.0]({{ site.baseurl }}/releases/v1.0.0/Changelog/) release on February 1st.

Kadalyst continues to work on the Archives in his free time, and has considerable plans for its future, including a proper database of entries and regular releases of the map with new entries.
